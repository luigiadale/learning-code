            Luigia D'Alessandro is a MKT Expert
            who's trying to learn how to code to
            go out from her comfort zone and learn
            new skills.
            That's why she started doing some lessons with 
            her bro, Lucio, who's a Senior Software
            Engineer. Now her bro is sick from getting
            his booster, but she's self practicising.
